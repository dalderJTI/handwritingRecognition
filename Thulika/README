Thulika is a simple handwriting recognition keyboard. It detects a single letter provided to it. Supports ENGLISH(beta version) and MALAYALAM languages.
Thulika is the first Android app that has brought handwriting recognition to an Indian language(Malayalam). 
Now you can use this keyboard even if the native OS doesn't support Malayalam.
Thulika has got a new look and feel which is drastically different from other keyboard apps. You can now use your entire screen to write! It is also semi-transparent, which gives you a glass like surface to write. The few blocks on the keyboard screen can also be moved, that is, the entire screen is configurable!
Write one letter at a time, and it'll recognize the letter.
